This example shows how to use MiXiMs implementation of the ieee802154 narrow band protocol.
It also provides an example on using the global blackboard provided by BaseWorldUtility.

The network consist of the "WorldUtilityStats" which extends from BaseWorldUtility to 
collect some global statistics as well as the usual ConnectionManager and a number of
host.
The hosts contain a special Traffic generation layer (also shows how to publish
global statistics to the global blackboard) which lies directly above the
NIC which moreover consist of the "csma"-mac layer module and the PhyLayer.
The PhyLayer uses "Decider802154Narrow" as a decider.

There are three "Test"s which try to show the characteristics of the used csma mac layer.
For each of these tests exists a "runTestX.sh" script as well as a "TestX.anf" file which execute
the configurations necessary to produce the result-files for the according "*.anf" file.
So you can take a look at the result of these tests by calling the "runTestX.sh" script and then
opening the according "TestX.anf" file.

Take a look at the omnetpp.ini for more details on the several test configurations.
