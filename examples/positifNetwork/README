This is an example of how to run experiments with the ported positif
algorithms. It contains some additional scripts for setting up experiments
and replaying previous scenarios.

In order to setup an experiment, create an omnetpp.ini file. This example
comes with three shell scripts that automatically generate 'omnetpp.ini'.
(The scripts were written and tested on a GNU/Linux platform, for Windows
you're on your own, but one might get them to work using Cygwin
(www.cygwin.com)).

	./bin/positifgen.sh <input scenario> omnetpp.ini
	-------------------
	This will take a scenario from ./input/scenarios and generate
	omnetpp.ini from that scenario. PositifNetwork will generate such a
	scenario file for each experiment as 'test.log'(*), storing that file
	with a more descriptive name in ./input/scenarios will preserve it
	for later reuse. Otherwise it will be overwritten the next time
	positifNetwork is run.

    (*) this name is configurable in the omnetpp.ini file, look for the line:
	sim.node[*].loc.outputfile = "test.log"

	./bin/randomgen.sh <node count> <anchor cols> <anchor rows> omnetpp.ini
	------------------
	This will generate a setup where the anchor nodes are placed on a
	grid defined by <anchor cols> and <anchor rows>, all other nodes are
	randomly placed within the boundaries of the experiment.

	./bin/chaosgen.sh <node count> <anchor count>  omnetpp.ini
	-----------------
	This will generate a setup where all nodes, including the anchors
	will be placed randomly.

Edit the generated omnetpp.ini at will, for example selecting a different
localization algorithm, or in-/decreasing the radiorange.

Run the experiment:

	./positifNetwork


General remarks:
----------------
- Don't use Node_Savvides_Mob, unless you know how to setup an experiment for
  it. It uses mobile anchors instead of static anchors, but still needs work
  before it will yield useful results.
