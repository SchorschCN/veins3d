I added two scripts to this folder:

rewrite.sh
----------
This script saves all .m files to .m~ and replaces the following strings:
 * gset		-> __gnuplot_set__
 * gplot	-> __gnuplot_plot__

In case one needs a backup of the original files, please be aware that
running this script twice will destroy the original .m files. So it
would be a good idea to do something like:

mkdir backup
mv *.m~ backup

restore.sh
----------
This script restores all .m~ files to .m, thus undoing the changes of
rewrite.sh.
