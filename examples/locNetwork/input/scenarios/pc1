# Topology description:
#   'nr-dimensions'     are we describing a 2-D or a 3-D topology?
#   'grid-bound'        the network is contained in a box of size
#                           [0:grid-bound] x [0:grid-bound] (x [0:grid-bound])
#   'radio-range'       the maximum length of a connection between two nodes
#   'connection'        a radio link between a source and destination node.
#                           Note that connections are directed and there
#                           need NOT be a reverse connection.
#   'measured-range'    (noisy) distance estimate obtained by receiver on
#                           a connection (same for each message).
#   'nr-nodes'          the number of nodes in the network
#   'nr-anchors'        the number of anchors in the network. An anchor is a
#                           node that 'knows' its true position, others do not.
#   'ID'                node identification (unsigned int), may be outside
#                           range [0:'nr-nodes'-1]
#   'position'          2 (or 3) floating point numbers
