How to run your own application in MiXiM?
=========================================
For your C++ application to run in MiXiM it needs to inherit from "Application" and register itself with the standard OMNeT++ methods. The easiest way to start a new application to run within MiXiM is to copy the testApp.* and start from there (just make sure to rename all occurences of TestApp).

Now (compile and) run the configurator in mixim_generator/QT called QTMiXiMGenerator. This should be able to find your newly created application and list it as one of the options to run within MiXiM. You can then select the amount of nodes you want, pick a MAC layer, etc. After clicking on finish it will create a omnetpp.ini file which you can place in the MiXiM directory. Then just (compile and) start MiXiM and watch your application being simulated.

This is the frozen version, which will not be maintained anymore. New development will be in the new MiXiM (mixim.sourceforge.net)
