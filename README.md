Extension of the Veins framework for three-dimensional simulation scenarios including the support of three-dimensional antenna patterns as well as a diffraction model covering the influence of the surrounding terrain and other vehicles in the LOS.

A detailed explanation as well as sample simulations (and results) can be found in the following paper:
