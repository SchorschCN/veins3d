This file contains the general installation hints 
to compile and start using MiXiM.


Requirements
============
- OMNeT++, at least version 3.2, 
  downloadable at www.omnetpp.org
  OMNeT++ must be compiled with dynamic NED loading enabled 
  (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes setting)
- make (or nmake)
- C++ compiler


Installation under Linux
========================
1. Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
   tar xzf mixim<VERSION>.tgz

2. Update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include the
   "mixim<VERSION>/lib" directory

3. Update your PATH variable to include the
   "mixim<VERSION>/bin" directory

4. run the mkmk shell script
   ./mkmk

5. type "make all" to make the mixim library and binary 
   and to build the test networks

TODO: we need to be more precise how to get started!!!

Finally try the example networks in the example folder or
build your own network using the configurator


Installation under Windows
==========================
1. Unpack the archive

2. modify the variable OMNETPP_ROOT in mkmk.cmd to point to your
   OMNeT++ installation directory.

3. Update your PATH variable to include the
   "mixim<VERSION>/bin" directory

4. run the mkmk.cmd script
   mkmk.cmd

5. type "nmake /f Makefile.vc all" to make the mxim library and
   binary and to build the test networks

Finally try the example networks in the example folder or
build your own network using the configurator


Installation under MAC OS
=========================
There are two possibilities to install mixim under MAC OS,
one is with shared libraries, one without.

1. Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
   tar xzf mixim<VERSION>.tgz

2. Modify the mkmk.mac script and choose shared libraries or not
   (just comment out the corresponding lines in the script)

3. If you go for shared libraries you need to update your
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (NOT LD_LIBRARY!) variable to include the
   "mixim<VERSION>/lib" directory

4. Update your PATH variable to include the
   "mixim<VERSION>/bin" directory

5. run the mkmk.mac shell script
   ./mkmk.mac

6. type "make all" to make the mixim library and binary
   and to build the test networks

Finally try the example networks in the example folder or
build your own network using the configurator
