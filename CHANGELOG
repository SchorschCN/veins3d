* fixed memory leak when propagation delay is simulated
* fixed a bug in the calculated receiving power of a signal which caused it to be greater zero before 
  and after its signal in certain cases
* fixed wrong calculation of position on "WRAP" border handling in BaseMobility
* fixed missing connections when the cells from ConnectionManager do not cover the playground size
  exactly
* fixed increasing heap memory usage while hosts sending AirFrames but wheren receiving any.
  This was caused by RSAM tracking every radio state although there wheren't any Signals on the
  channel to attenuate.
