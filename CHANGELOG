v1.2
+ added port of 802154 narrowband phy and mac layer of mobility-fw2 for omnet 4 from Jérôme Rousselot
+ added global blackboard functionality to BaseWorldUtility
+ introduced "csma" module which implements a generic CSMA mac protocol and will replace CSMAMacLayer 
  in the future
+ added depth dependent scaled display of hosts when GUI and 3-D is used
+ made members of Move protected, added functions for member access
  - 'setDirectionByVector' replaces the direct access to the member 'direction'
  - 'setDirectionByTarget' replaces the method 'setDirection'
+ BaseMobilitys host coordinates can be set to random values indepentently now
+ gave networks of examples more meaningfull and consistent names (same as the example)
+ renamed executeables for examples from "MiXiM" to <example name>
+ divided MacControlInfo into MacToNetwControlInfo and NetwToMacControlInfo
+ added a wizard to create a basic MiXiM-network as well as a wizard for creating your own AnalogueModel
+ added, updated or extended documentation for Radio, RSAM, ChannelInfo, MiXiM-basics, mobility,
  border-handling and CSMA MAC-Layer 
+ changed scheduling priority of AirFrames to slightly higher than normal to ensure channel consistency
+ added utility-method 'addDiscontinuity' to MappingUtils which provides a workaround to represent
  discontinuities in mappings by defining two entries as close as possible to each other
+ changed default signal created by BaseMacLayer's 'createSignal'-method to use a rectangular function
  for TX-power
* fixed memory leak when propagation delay is simulated
* fixed a bug in the calculated receiving power of a signal which caused it to be greater zero before 
  and after its signal in certain cases
* fixed wrong calculation of position on "WRAP" border handling in BaseMobility
* fixed missing connections when the cells from ConnectionManager do not cover the playground size
  exactly
* fixed increasing heap memory usage while hosts sending AirFrames but wheren't receiving any.
  This was caused by RSAM tracking every radio state although there wheren't any Signals on the
  channel to attenuate.

v1.1
+ added port of EnergyFramework written by Laura Marie Feeney
+ added "headerLength" parameter to physical layer and fixed wrong MacPkt length in Mac80211
* fixed wrong initialization order of static time and frequency Dimension members by introducing time-/frequency_static() wrapper methods

v1.0
- first release
