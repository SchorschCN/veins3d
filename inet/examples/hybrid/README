Network for testing a hybrid host containing different wired and wireless NICs.


This network contains several hosts equipped with different types of NICs, in
particular ethernet, 802.11 and 802.15.4 (TI_CC2420).

Further the network contains a hybrid host (hybridRouter) which is equipped with
all of these types of NICs. Thus the hybridRouter is capable of establishing a
connection to every host in the network as well as route packages between two
hosts.

All hosts which are not the router are equipped with a PING-application. The
several configurations demonstrate the sending of PINGs between the different
hosts, routed by the hybridRouter.
